# ut_opioids

The core of this dataset comes from the Utah Open Data Catalog. The dataset shows teh number of opioid prescriptions from each doctor in the state aver a two year period. 

I had two goals with this project:
  1. Ananlyze the cities which had the most outsized prescription rates of opioids, and determine if any demographic factors influenced this rate.
  2. Map the rate of opioid presciptions by county, and visualize the largest per capita sources of opioids in the state
  
I achieved these goals using a mixture of R and Python for anlysis, and ggplot2 and Tableau for visualization.
